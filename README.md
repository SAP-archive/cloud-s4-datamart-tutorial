# Product Analytics Sample SAPUI5 app
This repository contains a sample SAPUI5 application, which is used in a tutorial on [developers.sap.com](https://developers.sap.com).

## Data Mart Scenario
In some cases you want to build a data mart for analyzing data in your SAP on-premises backend system. In this tutorial group we will show you how to build a data mart on SAP Cloud Platform, and how to build your custom analytics application on top of this data mart. You will set up a SAP NetWeaver 7.50 system in a Virtual Machine on your computer. Subsequently you will set up a SAP HANA database in your SAP Cloud Platform, establish connectivity between your backend system and the HANA database, and then set up a data replication between the two systems. You will model a new analytics view on the HANA database, and expose the custom view as an OData service. Finally, you will build a custom analytics application on SAP Cloud Platform using SAPUI5. **This repository contains the sources for this custom analytics application**.
